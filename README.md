### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Water Resources (WRS), Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC).

My research and teaching concentrate on microwave remote sensing of vegetation and soil moisture. Specifically, I am passionate about forests and their hydraulic system. I have a great love for fieldwork, and I am interested in the opportunistic use of existing data networks.
